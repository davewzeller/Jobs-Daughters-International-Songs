     <p class="reading_font">Before the Bethel meeting, the Marshal, the Senior Custodian and the Junior Custodian shall prepare the Bethel Room by putting all the paraphernalia in its proper
place as shown on the floor plan. (Plate 1 )
After the Bethel meeting, the Marshal, the Senior Custodian and the Junior Custodian shall remove all paraphernalia from the Bethel Room and put it in the proper
storage place.
The Custodian of Paraphernalia shall supervise this part of the work at every meeting.
Adjust the floor plan according to the size of the Bethel Room and position of the doors.
The Altar is placed east of the center of the Bethel Room with a kneeling bench or cushion on the east side, unless the Altar location is permanently fixed in the
Bethel Room. For Installations, a kneeling bench may also be placed on the west side of the Altar.
The Bible is placed on the Altar near the east edge with the back at the center and the open edge facing north. There shall be no loose papers in the Bible or on the
Altar. The version of the Bible used shall include the Book of Job. Another appropriate Holy Book may also be placed on the Altar, as space will allow. Only the Bible used
for the Bethel meeting shall be opened by the Chaplain when attending at the Altar. Nothing except the Bible, other appropriate Holy Book, and the Altar cloth shall be
placed on the Altar. With the approval of the Executive Members of the Bethel Guardian Council, flowers may be placed on the Altar (not the Bible) during the Memorial
Ceremony or other appropriate ceremonies. The flowers shall remain there until the Bethel meeting is closed.
The chairs of the five Messengers, the Chaplain and the Treasurer are placed in the semicircle facing the East. The backs of the Chaplain's and the Treasurer's chairs
are on a line with the west side of the Altar, allowing three steps from the north or south side of the Altar to these chairs.
The First and the Third Messengers' chairs are placed three steps west of the Chaplain's and the Treasurer's chairs. The right side of the First Messenger's chair is in
line with the center of the Treasurer's chair. The left side of the Third Messenger's chair is in line with the center of the Chaplain's chair.
The Second and Fourth Messengers' chairs are placed two steps west of the First and Third Messengers' chairs. The right side of the Second Messenger's chair is in line
with the center of the First Messenger's chair. The left side of the Fourth Messenger's chair is inline with the center of the Third Messenger's chair.
The Fifth Messenger's chair is placed two steps west of the Second and Fourth Messengers' chairs inline with the center of the Altar and the Honored Queen's station.
This should form a perfect semicircle and can be adjusted to any room by shortening or lengthening the steps taken.
The chairs of the Librarian the Senior Custodian, the Junior Custodian and the Recorder shall be placed two steps east of the East Line with the back of the chairs
three steps west of the Honored Queen's podium or at the bottom step of the East Dais.
The pedestal for the Dove is placed between the stations of the Junior Custodian and the Recorder and on a line with the station of the Treasurer. The Dove faces
west.
The pedestal for the Urn of Incense is placed between the stations of the Senior Custodian and the Librarian and on a line with the station of the Chaplain. The handle of the Urn is turned north.
The Horn of Plenty is placed on the Honored Queen's podium, south of the center, near the west edge, facing northwest. The Lily of the Valley is placed north of the
center, on the northwest corner.
The Charter is placed at the foot of the west side of the Honored Queen's podium unless other provisions for its placement have been approved. Nothing except the
Charter shall be placed between the Honored Queen's podium and the Altar unless otherwise specified in a ceremony.
The National Emblem and all other flags to be presented are placed unfurled in the Preparation Room. The bases for the National Emblem and the Bethel Flag are
placed at the right and left, respectively, of the Senior and Junior Princesses' stations.
A small Bible, to be used by late, unobligated visitors in taking the Pledge of Honor for Adults, is placed in the Anteroom before each meeting.
There shall be no open flame equipment, such as candles and/or candelabra, used during any Bethel meeting or Ceremony of Installation. Electrified candles and
candelabra may be used.
The lights may be dimmed only during prayers and the Closing Formation.</p>
