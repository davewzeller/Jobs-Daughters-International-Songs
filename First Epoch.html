     <p class="reading_font">JUNIOR PRINCESS: Guide and Marshal, you will conduct the Pilgrims east ofthe Altar for the lectures of the First and Second Messengers. The
        unior Princess is seated.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Guide instructs the Pilgrims to follow her. March music: "Love Devine." The Guide leads the Pilgrims east past the station of the Treasurer, turns
        left on the Altar Line and sto s so that thev rims are centered evenl s aced east of the Altar facin west. (Plate 25)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">GUIDE: First Messenger, (rises) you will begin the story ofthe life of Job for these Pilgrims.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">On the edge of an Arabian desert, there lived centuries ago a man whose name wasJob. He was a pious and upright man who loved and feared
        God and turned away from all evil. God, in His goodness, blessed this man with great riches.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">With his wife, seven sons and three daughters, he lived in the valley in peace, happiness and plenty. His vast estates stretched many miles over
            the plains and into the hills where grazed his countless flocks ofsheep. Dotting the landscape in the lowlands, and shaded by giant palms, were
            the homes of his sons.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">At the close of each day, it was the custom of the younger members ofthis happy family to feast at one of their homes. Job, not wishing to
            impose the gravity ofhis years upon the festivities, remained at his own home in peace. Job feared that his children, in their worldly pleasures
            and untold wealth, might forget or turn away from God. By regular hours of worship, he taught his family to share in his righteousness.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">In the Heavenly Council, God commended the piety of his faithful servant Job. The Adversary, whose mission was to test the faith of the people
            ofthe earth, accused Job of being pious because God had blessed him with great wealth and extensive estates and possessions. He declared that if
            God should take away Job's riches, his piety and reverence would turn to hate. God permitted the Adversary to try Job's faith, but warned him not
            to do bodily harm to Job. So the Adversary set forth on his mission. The First Messenger turns right, returns to her station and is seated. (Plate 25)</p>
        <p class="reading_font">GUIDE: Second Messenger, (rises) you will continue the story of the life of Job.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">SECOND MESSENGER: Takes position west of the Altar by walking on a diagonal line, stopping between the stations of the First and Third Messengers. (Plate 25)</p>
        <p class="reading_font">Job was happy, for his children were about him. The days faded into evening, and he looked out on the peaceful land and watched the stars as
            they came forth in silent procession. He silently glorified the Great Hand which controls the universe.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">But there came a day when the Adversary struck Job with his wrath. Messengers falling at Job's feet told him of disaster following disaster; his
            flocks destroyed by lightning; his beasts of burden carried away by plundering tribes; his servants put to the sword; and finally, the death of his
            sons and daughters by a mighty wind which laid low the homes offeasting and pleasure.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">Job, in anguish, cast himselfupon the ground, laying his forehead in the dust.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">The Adversary watched, ever ready to return to his Master with the story of Job's fall from his faith in God. In spite ofhis misfortunes, Job re-
            mained steadfast and continued to worship God.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">Again the Adversary approached the throne saying, "All that a man hath will he give for his life. Put forth Thine hand and touch his flesh and
            he will turn from Thee." God answered, "He is in thine hand, but save his life."</p>
        <p class="reading_font">The Adversary went forth. Job's suffering was intense. He was banished from the habitations ofman. Yet, in his suffering and misfortune, he
            remained faithful to God, saying, "Shall we receive good at the hand of God and not expect to receive misfortune?"</p>
        <p class="reading_font">Guide and Marshal, you will conduct the Pilgrims to the Junior Princess. March music: "Love Divine." The Second Messenger returns to her station
            by stepping back until on a line with her station, turns right, goes to her station and is seated. (Plate 25)</p>
        <p class="reading_font">The Guide instructs the Pilgrims to follow her. The Guide turns right and marches to the North Marching Line, turns right and marches to the East
            Line, turns right and marches south until the Pilgrims are centered evenly spaced, directly in front ofthe Honored Queen, facing east. (Plate 26)</p>
        <p class="reading_font">JUNIOR PRINCESS: We hope that the lessons of this Epoch have been deeply impressed upon you, and that they will be carried with you forever.
            Remember the pious and prosperous Job, passing in peace over his vast estates, ever stopping to give a word ofcheer to his servants. Hear him
            bless his children and ra thatth m continue to live in the fear of God.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">When the shades ofnight begin to fall, he goes forth into the gathering gloom and hears God's voice in the waters ofthe river, in the song ofthe
            night birds and in all nature. He looks toward the homes ofhis sons and, as one by one the candle lights are extinguished, he offers a silent prayer
            that the morrow will be the same as today - full of love, peace and plenty.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">Then, as a storm out ofthe southland, comes blow after blow on the head of this pious man. His wealth is swept away, his family is destroyed
            and his body is torn with pains of disease. Yet, in his hour of trial when all the world seemed to forsake him, he remained God's faithful servant.
            Job was steadfast.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">We learn from this Epoch always to remain faithful to God in our every thought, word and act, no matter what earthly trials we may be called
            upon to endure. Be steadfast, practice love, dispense light, shun falsehood and believe only in the truth.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">The sign of the First Epoch is given (Junior Princess exemplifies sign - Proficiency Lesson 2). Pilgrims, you will
            exemxemplify life with me this sign. Junior Princess exemplifies the sign a second time with Pilgrims.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">The response is (Junior Princess gives response - Proficiency Lesson 3). Pilgrims, you will repeat after me the response of the First Epoch. Junior
            Princess gives the response a second time, the Pilgrims repeat the response.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">The mystic number ofthis Epoch is seven. It alludes to the number of Job's sons and the measure of his flocks.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">The emblem ofthis Epoch is the White Dove, which symbolizes purity and truth. At the word "emblem" the Junior Princess extends her left
            hand toward the Dove until the sentence is completed. It is also symbolic ofthe name of Job's first daughter whom he called Jemima, which means "dove."</p>
        <p class="reading_font">At the word "emblem" the Junior Custodian turns, faces the center of the line of Pilgrims and extends the Dove, using both hands. When the Junior
            Princess has completed the paragraph, the Junior Custodian brings back the Dove, faces west and remains standing.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">Chord for the Offcers and Bethel Choir to rise. All the Daughters sing "Come Holy Spirit" or "Come Holy Spirit* Heavenly Dove." Refer to the Music
            Ritual. Chord to be seated. The Junior Princess and the Junior Custodian remain standing.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">JUNIOR PRINCESS: Honored Queen, the Pilgrims are prepared for the Second Epoch. The Junior Princess remains standing until the Junior Custo-
            dian has replaced the Dove on the pedestal, then the Junior Princess and the Junior Custodian are seated at the same time.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: (rises) Senior Princess, (rises) the lessons ofthe Second Epoch are to be taught under your direction. The Honored Queen is
            seated.</p>
