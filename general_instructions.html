     <div><h1>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS</h1></div>    
     
     <p class="reading_font">The current Ritual adopted by the Supreme Guardian Council shall be followed, without change, for opening and closing each Bethel and for Initiation. There is no
short form of the Ritual. Officers shall memorize all ritualistic work.
Under a Special Dispensation to exemplify the ritualistic work of the Order for adult Masonic organizations, all business and Escort, Introductions and Honors may
be omitted with the approval of the Executive Members of the Bethel Guardian Council and only Opening, Initiation and Closing exemplified. The Majority Ceremony,
Obligation Ceremony or other appropriate ceremony may be substituted for Initiation with the approval of the Executive Members of the Bethel Guardian Council.
AT ALL TIMES, A FEMALE ADULT SELECTED BY THE EXECUTIVE MEMBERS OF THE BETHEL GUARDIAN COUNCIL MUST REMAIN OUTSIDE THE OUTER DOOR TO
ASSIST THE OUTER GUARD IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTIES.
At open meetings for Installation or other purposes, the signs and other Proficiency Lessons of the Order shall not be used. At closed meetings, the Ritual is confidential until the Honored Queen directs the Inner Guard to notify the Outer Guard that the Bethel meeting is closed. When the doors are open, anyone may view the
Opening Ceremony through the Bethel Flag presentation and the Closing Formation. The Bethel members, with the approval of the Executive Members of the Bethel
Guardian Council, may choose the Cross, the Square and Compass, or the Triangle Formation for their Closing Ceremony.
The Honored Queen, with the approval of the Executive Members of the Bethel Guardian Council, may appoint substitute officers to learn the ritualistic work for
absent Officers. In an emergency arising from the absence of both a regular Officer and the substitute Officer, a member requested to substitute may read from the Ritual unless she has memorized the part.
Officers and members of the Bethel Choir sit upright, with feet flat on the floor and hands in lap. When Officers stand, hands are at sides.
During the Opening Ceremony, an Officer addressed by the Honored Queen rises, faces the Honored Queen, and nods her head. She does not speak until she has
raised her head; then she answers, "Honored Queen." At all other times during the ritualistic work, Officers do not nod or answer "Honored Queen."
During the Order of Business, members desiring to speak must stand and be recognized by the Honored Queen before speaking. The members shall begin their re-
marks by saying, "Honored Queen." During a Bethel meeting, current Officers may perform the duties, as required, of offices not filled.
The speaking parts of the Ritual are in bold print and follow an Officer's title; i.e., HONORED QUEEN: (speaking part).
Passing between the Altar and East Dais is prohibited except as provided in the Ritual or in a special ceremony.</p>
