     <p class="reading_font">SENIOR PRINCESS: Pilgrims, you are bound to
      us by the sacred pledge of Job's Daughters. The
      lessons which we learn here assist us in building our
      own individual character.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Guide and Marshal, you will conduct the Pilgrims
      east of the Altar for the lectures of the Third and
      Fourth Messengers. The Senior Princess is seated. The
      Guide instructs the Pilgrims to follow her. March music:
      "Lead On, 0 King Eternal". The Guide turns right,
      marches to the South Marching Line, turns right, marches
      to the West Line, turns right on the West Line, then
      marches on a diagonal line between the stations of the
      Second and the Fifth Messengers, through the semicircle
      to the Altar Line, turns right and stops so that the Pilgrims
      are centered, evenly spaced, east of the Altar, facing west.
      (Plate 27)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">GUIDE: Third Messenger, (rises) you will relate
      the temptations of Job.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">THIRD MESSENGER: Tums right and takes
      position west of the Altar between the stations of the First
      and Third Messengers. (Plate 27)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Job, stricken with a never-ceasing torture, sought
      refuge upon a heap of ashes. He was almost helpless,
      and his feeble efforts to arise from the ground
      provoked the mirth of the children who played about.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">His companions were beggars and outcasts. The
      day faded into evening. Again, Job heard the twilight
      song bird, but its strain had changed to sorrow. He
      gazed with reverence upon the horizon streaked with
      the afterglow of a lowering sun. His eyes paused upon
      the ruins of the homes of his sons, and, in his troubled
      mind, again he saw the candlelights grow dark - one
      by one - until the last. All was darkness, and Job, in
      the agony of his heart, cried aloud, "Why does God
      continue life to the wretched who long for death?"</p>
     <p class="reading_font">As daylight dispelled the gloom, there came out of
      the East three men. They were the friends  of  his youth, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar. They met by 
      appointment to tell Job of their sympathy,  for  the story of his misfortune had traveled to the 
      farthermost parts. They sought Job among the outcasts but knew him not. When at last they found 
      their friend, they looked upon him in great pity and watched with him. They knew that his grief and 
      suffering were intense. They waited until Job, in his misery, broke the silence.
      </p>
     <p class="reading_font">At length Job spoke, "Let the day perish wherein I
      was born." He continued portraying a peaceful vision
      of death and release from earthly suffering. He
      awakened to his real condition and his words rose like
      the storm after the lull. "Why is light given to a man
      whose way is hid?" Job spoke with the passion of
      despair and the bitterness of his misery. The eldest of
      his friends reminded him that calamity destroys only
      the wicked and the righteous will endure.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Again and yet again, the friends insisted that Job
      was being punished for sinful acts. Job replied to each
      in turn. He maintained his purity and righteousness
      and wondered at the work of God's Divine Hand. The
      Third Messenger turns left, returns to her station and is
      seated. (Plate 27)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">GUIDE: Fourth Messenger, (rises) you will relate
      the triumph of Job.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">FOURTH MESSENGER: Takes position west of the
      Altar by walking on a diagonal line, stopping between the
      stations of the First and Third Messengers. (Plate 27)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Job's cries to God to appear were heard by the
      Almighty. There came a wind whirling about the
      mound, and out of the tumult came God's answer,
      "Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without
      knowledge? Where wast thou when I laid the
      foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast
      understanding." So on and on the whispering of the
      wind asked Job, "Who shall make the sun to shine and
      the moon to walk its silvery path; the troubled waters
      of the sea to be calm and the rivers to flow their
      winding course; the rolling thunder and the flashing
      lightning to cease; the birds to sing their lay and the
      beasts to roam the plain; and the earth to move in its
      appointed course? Who shall satisfy the desolate and
      vast ground with gentle rains and scatter the east wind
      upon the earth?"</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Job heard in shame and answered, "Behold I will
      lay my hand upon my mouth. Once I have spoken, but
      now I will not answer." Again the voice persists, "If
      thou hast an arm like God, take up the sword and rule
      the universe, but lay low all that is proud, subdue the
      forces of evil, and hide the faces of the wicked in
      darkness."</p>
     <p class="reading_font">darkness."
      Job answered, "I know Thou can do everything,
      and that no thought can be hidden from Thee.
      Therefore, I have uttered that which I knew not, and I
      repent in dust and ashes."</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Then the Lord spake unto Eliphaz saying, "My
      wrath is kindled against thee and thy two friends, for
      ye have not spoken of me the things that are right, as
      my servant Job hath."</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Job's righteousness had prevailed. God laid His
      hand upon him, healed his wounds, guided him to the
      ruins of his home and restored to him twice as much of
      the world's goods as he had before. So Job lived for
      many years in peace and plenty as a reward for his
      steadfastness during the trial by the Adversary.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Guide and Marshal, you will conduct the Pilgrims
      to the Senior Princess. March music: "Lead On, 0
      King Eternal". The Fourth Messenger returns to her
      station by stepping back until on a line with her station,
      turns left, goes to her station and is seated. (Plate 27)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Guide instructs the Pilgrims to follow her. The
      Guide turns left and marches to the South Marching Line,
      turns left and marches to the East Line, turns left and
      marches north until the Pilgrims are centered, evenly
      spaced, directly in front of the Honored Queen, facing
      east. (Plate 28)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">GUIDE: Senior Princess, (rises) these Pilgrims
      have passed through the ceremony of the Second
      Epoch and are now ready for further instruction. The
      Senior Custodian rises when the Guide addresses the
      Senior Princess, turns, picks up the Urn of Incense with
      both hands, and stands facing directly west.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">SENIOR PRINCESS: Pilgrims, you have heard the
      sad story of Job's anguish. The man whom God
      corrects should count himself happy, for his correction
      is meant to awaken him from his dream of evil and
      lead him into a broader, cleaner life, rich in blessings.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">God knows your every thought and watches over
      you in hours of pleasure and in times of misfortune.
      Every thought is like a dewdrop from Heaven, its
      usefulness is forecast and its purpose fulfilled. We will
      give ourselves to faith that never faileth, kind thoughts
      to our fellow men, inspiring confidence and hope of
      reward.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The sign of the Second Epoch is given (Senior
      Princess exemplifies the sign - Proficiency Lesson 4).
      Pilgrims, you will exemplify with me this sign. Senior
      Princess exemplifies the sign a second time with the
      Pilgrims.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The response is (Senior Princess gives response -
      Proficiency Lesson 5). Pilgrims, you will repeat after
      me the response of the Second Epoch. Senior Princess
      gives the response a second time; the Pilgrims repeat the
      response.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The mystic number of this Epoch is three. It
      alludes to the three daughters of Job and his three
      friends from the far East.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The emblem of this Epoch is the Urn of Incense,
      which in all ages has symbolized prayer. At the word
      "emblem" the Senior Princess extends her right hand
      toward the Um until the sentence is completed. It is also
      symbolic of the name of Job's second daughter whom
      he called Kezia, meaning "cassia", used in incense. At
      the word "emblem" the Senior Custodian turns, faces the
      center of the line of Pilgrims and extends the Um, using
      both hands. When the Senior Princess has completed the
      paragraph, the Senior Custodian brings back the Um,
      faces west and remains standing.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Chord for the Officers and Bethel Choir to rise. All
      Daughters sing "My Faith Looks Up to Thee" or "Faith
      of Our Fathers". Refer to the Music Ritual. Chord to be
      seated. The Senior Princess and the Senior Custodian
      remain standing.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">SENIOR PRINCESS: Honored Queen, the
      Pilgrims are prepared for the Third Epoch. The Senior
      Princess remains standing until the Senior Custodian has
      replaced the Um on the pedestal, then the Senior
      Custodian and the Senior Princess are seated at the same
      time.</p>
