     If the Bethel has no Bethel Flag Bearer or other Choir member present to carry the flag, the Honored Queen may appoint an Officer to serve as the Flag Bearer for that meeting, or the flag maybe placed in the East before the meeting, and she will omit the instruction to the Bethel Flag Bearer.</p>
