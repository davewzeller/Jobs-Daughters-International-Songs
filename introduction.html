             <p class="reading_font">The benefits of an organization for girls with Masonic relationship are numerous. Job's Daughters is a fraternal, international organization for girls that teaches
leadership skills, public speaking, self-confidence, charitable service, respect for parents and family, and love of one's country. The influence an organization of this
kind has in a community cannot be estimated. Members of Job's Daughters make life-long friends while helping others.
While the lessons of Job's Daughters were first set forth in 1920 by its founder, Ethel T. Wead Mick, they are as true today as when they were written. There is nothing
more fitting to young women than the beautiful sentiment expressed in the Book of Job as unfolded by lectures, symbols and songs. The ritualistic work demonstrates
that through life, from early childhood to old age, we encounter trials and tribulations which must be met and overcome.
The meeting place is called "Bethel," which means "holy place." Officers and Choir wear Grecian robes similar to those worn in the days of Job. The official regalia
represents a forward, upward and onward trend toward higher ideals.
The 42nd Chapter, 15th verse of the Book of Job tells us that, "In all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job, and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren."
