The National Emblem of other countries is placed in the East between the flag of the host country and the station of the Senior Princess.
Citizens pay respect to their National Emblem according to the custom of their country. Those who are not citizens of the country whose flag is being presented
stand at attention with hands at their sides.
The flag is carried according to the custom of the country. (See Supreme Constitution and Bylaws, SI-21 Flag Protocol.)</p>

<p class="reading_font">Refer to the Music Ritual for all music to be used in the Flag Ceremony <a href="Songs/06 Track 6.mp3" target="_blank" class="songs" title="(National Anthem)">(National Anthem)</a>.</p>

<p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: Marshal, you will display the National Emblem. March music. </p>

<p class="reading_font">The Marshal retires to the Preparation Room by marching to the West Line, turns north, marches to a point in line with the Preparation Room door, turns west, and
marches to the Preparation Room.
The Honored Queen sounds three raps of the gavel (***). The Officers in the semicircle face inward. The Marshal, carrying the National Emblem, enters the Bethel
Room through the Preparation Room doorway, marches to the West Line, turns south and marches to a point where she can proceed on a diagonal line between the stations of the Fourth and Fifth Messengers. She stops west of the Altar, between the stations of the First and Third Messengers.

<p class="reading_font">In the United States and its possessions, as the Marshal enters, the Honored Queen places her hand over her heart, fingers together, keeping her hand flat against her
body, forearm on a slight angle in a natural position. This will be the signal for all citizens of the United States to assume this position. This salute is held until after the
Pledge of Allegiance is given. In other countries where a salute is given, the salute shall be according to governmental regulations. In a country where a salute is not
given, all stand at attention, with hands at sides.</p>

<p class="reading_font">The Marshal does not change the position of the flag at the Altar. All except the Marshal sing the <a href="Songs/06 Track 6.mp3" target="_blank" class="songs" title="(National Anthems)">National Anthem</a></p>

<p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: This flag is an emblem of the liberties we enjoy, the protection of our homes, and the freedom of our institutions. It is a symbol of the blood
of our forefathers, who died that our country might- endure. We love it and ail-for-which ii stands. Marshal, place it in the East at the fight-of the Senior Princess.
March music.</p>

<p class="reading_font">The Marshal turns and marches north, then east, between the Altar and the station of the Chaplain, and marches on a straight line to the East Dais. As the Marshal
marches east, all turn to face the flag. The Marshal ascends the dais and places the flag in the base provided at the right of the Senior Princess. The staff is placed in such
a way that the flag covers the staff. The emblem at the top of the staff faces west. </p>

<p class="reading_font">At this time, in countries where there is a Pledge of Allegiance to be given, the Marshal steps back one step and joins in the salute. The position of the Marshal is adjusted to suit the dais.</p>

<p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: All citizens of (country) will join in pledging allegiance to the flag.</p>

<p class="reading_font">As the Marshal turns to return to her station the Honored Queen sounds one- rap of the gavel (*). The Marshal retraces her steps to the East Line
