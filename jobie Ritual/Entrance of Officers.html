     <div><h1>Entrance of officers</h1></div>                                                     
     <p class="reading_font">As the Officers, Bethel Choir and members sing <a class="songs" href="Songs/03 Track 3.mp3" target="_blank" title="Open the Gates of the Bethel">"Open the Gates of the Bethel,"</a> the Guide and the Marshal slowly open the doors. The Guide and the Marshal time the
opening of the doors so that they are standing in the center of the doorway as the introduction of the song is completed. The doors are opened one quarter of the way
on the first "Open," halfway on the second "Open," and three-fourths of the way on the third "Open." The doors are completely open, and the Guide and the Marshal are
in position, on the fourth "Open."</p>

<p class="reading_font">The Officers quietly mark time to eight chords, starting with the left foot, then begin marching with the left foot on the first accented beat of the music. The Officers,
Bethel Choir and members continue singing as the Officers, marching an arms length apart, enter the Bethel Room. <a href="img/plate 3.png" target="_top" title="Plate 3 Opening March - Entrance of Officers">(Plate 3)</a></p>

<p class="reading_font">The Guide and the Marshal march east until they reach the Altar Line.</p>

<p class="reading_font">The Guide turns a square corner to the left (north), marches past the station of the Chaplain <a href="img/Plate 4.png" target="_self" title="(Plate 4): Opening March">(Plate 4)</a>, turns left (west), making a complete semicircle around the
outside of the Messengers' stations, past the station of the Treasurer, turns left to the south side of the Altar, turns right and marches east. <a href="img/Plate 4.png" target="_self" title="(Plate 4): Opening March">(Plate 4)</a></p> 

<p class="reading_font">The Marshal turns a square corner to the right (south), marches past the station of the Treasurer <a href="img/Plate 4.png" target="_self" title="(Plate 4): Opening March">(Plate 4)</a>, turns right (west), making a complete semicircle around
the outside of the Messengers' stations, past the station of the Chaplain, turns right to the north side of the Altar, turns left and marches east. <a href="img/Plate 4.png" target="_self" title="(Plate 4): Opening March">(Plate 4)</a></p>

<p class="reading_font">The Marshal is always on the inside, one step from the semicircle, and the Guide is always on the outside when marching around the Messengers' stations. The Guide
should always allow space for the Marshal and her line of Officers to march without crowding. The Marshal should shorten her steps when marching around the Messengers' stations to permit the Guide to make up the greater distance.</p>

<p class="reading_font">When the Guide and the Marshal, followed by the Officers, reach the East Line, all stop and form an aisle. The aisle is wide enough to allow the Princesses to proceed
east side by side. As the Princesses approach the base of the aisle, the Bethel Guardian nods to the Officers and the Officers face center. The Officers do not return the
nod.</p>
<p class="reading_font">The Princesses, followed by the Honored Queen, march east through the aisle, past the Guide and the Marshal. The Princesses back to a position in line with and east
of the Guide and the Marshal and then face center.</p>

<p class="reading_font">The Honored Queen ascends the dais. The Associate Bethel Guardian extends his hand to assist her.</p>

<p class="reading_font">BETHEL GUARDIAN: I have the pleasure of introducing the Honored Queen (name).</p>  

<p class="reading_font">The Bethel Guardian presents her with the gavel. The Honored Queen does not sound the gavel.
HONORED QUEEN: The Officers will take their stations. 

<a href="img/plate 5.png" title="(Plate 5)">(Plate 5)</a>

<p class="reading_font">The Musician plays a chord for the Officers to face east. The Officers, Bethel Choir and members sing the second verse of

<a class="songs" href="Songs/03 Track 3.mp3" target="_blank" title="Open the Gates of the Bethel">"Open the Gates of the Bethel,"</a></p>

 <p class="reading_font">As the Officers
march to their stations.
<p class="reading_font">The Princesses ascend the dais and take their stations.</p>
<p class="reading_font"> soon as the Officers have left the East Line, the Bethel Guardian and the Associate Bethel Guardian descend the dais

<p class="reading_font">As the Messengers, the Chaplain and the Treasurer reach a point in front of their individual stations, they turn square corners north and south and march to their
stations, all facing east together. 

<a href="img/plate 6.png" title="Plate 6: Opening March(continued)">(plate 6)</a>  </p>

<p class="reading_font">As the Librarian, the Senior Custodian, the Recorder and the Junior Custodian reach a point in front of their individual stations, they turn square corners, march east
o steps to their stations, then face west by turning inward. 

<a href="img/plate 6.png" title="Plate 6: Opening March(continued)">(plate 6)</a></p>

<p class="reading_font">The Inner and the Outer Guards follow the Guide and the Marshal through the semicircle. As they pass the Fifth Messenger's station, the Inner and the Outer Guards
arch diagonally toward the doors of the Anteroom and the Preparation Room. The Guide and the Marshal proceed to their stations in the west.
