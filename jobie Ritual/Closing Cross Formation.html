     <p class="reading_font">At the West Line, the Guide turns right and the Marshal turns left, followed by the Officers, and march to the center of the West Line. At the center, the Officers in the two lines alternately turn east; first the Guide turns, then the Marshal, followed by the Inner Guard, Outer Guard, Treasurer, Chaplain, Fifth, Fourth and Second Messengers in the order named. The First Messenger, the Recorder, the Junior Custodian and the Junior Princess will form the south arm of the Cross; the Third Messenger, the Librarian, the Senior Custodian, and Senior Princess will form the north arm of the Cross. They face east
on the West Line.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">For less than a full corps of officers, adjust the base and arms of the Cross accordingly. Always keep the Honored Queen at the base of the Cross and the Princesses on the outside arms of the Cross.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">When the Officers forming the arms of the Cross are in position on the West Line (and the Bethel Choir, if in the West, are in position), the Honored Queen marches around the south side of the Altar and takes her position west of the Altar. As she moves around the Altar, the arms of the Cross move east, eight across and stop on a line with the Chaplain. <a href="img/Plate 14.png" target="_blank" title="(Plate 14)">(Plate 14)</a></p>
     <p class="reading_font">When the Officers are in the Cross Formation and the song has been completed, the Musician plays three chords for the Officers to kneel. On the first chord, they kneel on the RIGHT knee, on the second chord they go down on the LEFT knee, and on the third chord they assume the Attitude of Prayer.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">All Daughters sing one or two verses of <a href="Songs/45 Track 45.mp3" class="songs" target="_blank" title=""Nearer, My God to Thee"">"Nearer, My God to Thee"</a> or <a href="Songs/46 Track 46.mp3" class="songs" target="_blank" title=""Let There Be Peace on Earth."">                    "Let There Be Peace on Earth."</a> The second verse may be sung by any number of Daughters.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">With the approval of the Executive Members of the Bethel Guardian Council, members of the Bethel may be released from the Attitude of Prayer to sign. Or All Daughters repeat the Mizpah Benediction.</p>
