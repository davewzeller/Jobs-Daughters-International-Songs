<p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: We read in the Book of Job that "In all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job, and their
father gave them inheritance among their brethren." This is the passage upon which Job's Daughters is founded. In our lessons, we
strive to teach that to be fair is to do good. We are all daughters ofGod, and by the most intimate ties we are related to the Masonic
Fraternity, that organization which stands for the brotherhood of humanity. While Job's Daughters is no part of this fraternity,there is a great work for us to do. We must learn and practice reverence for God, loyalty to our flag, respect
for our elders and love for all the world.</p>
<p class="reading_font">In the story of Job we learn that if amid all the temptations of life we remain faithful to our Creator, we
  will be enriched with His blessings. Before you continue your journey, you are required to take a solemn Obligation to remain faithful to our teachings. This will be communicated by our Chaplain. Guide and
  Marshal, you will conduct the Pilgrims west ofthe Altar. The Honored Queen remains standing.</p>

  Altar and the station of the Chaplain to a point in line with the front of the Third Messenger's chair. The Guide
  turns and marches south between the stations of the First and Third Messengers. All face east. The Guide

  heads. The Guide takes her position on the south side of the Pilgrims, the Marshal on the north. <a href="img/plate 24.png" target="_blank" title=""Plate 24"">Plate 24</a>

    <p class="reading_font">CHAPLAIN: This solemn pledge is to be freely given by you, and I trust you will, throughout your lives,
      remember this scene and the words you here repeat. This pledge is shared by all of us, so the Obligation
      you are about to assume is a privilege and a benefit. You will repeat after me:</p>

        Prayer when the Chaplain assumes the Attitude of Prayer. The Chaplain does not close her eyes nor bow her
