     <p class="reading_font">If possible, unobligated visitors should be seated together west of the Altar Line. The Chaplain may turn toward the visitors when giving the pledge if all are on one side of the room; otherwise she faces the Altar.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: As messengers of truth we are again assembled. Before continuing with our ritualistic ceremony, we ask all adults who are attending a Bethel meeting for the first time to
assume a Pledge of Honor. All adults who are attending a Bethel meeting for the first time will please rise for this- pledge. Unobligated visitors rise.-The Associate Bethel Guardian rises-and repeats
the pledge with the visitors</p>
     <p class="reading_font">If there are no unobligated visitors, the Honored Queen sounds one rap of the gavel (*).</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: Officers, you will rise. Pause as the Officers rise. Chaplain, you will attend at the Altar. Altar music: <a class="songs"  href="Songs/17 Track 17.mp3" title=""Holy, Holy, Holy"">"Holy, Holy, Holy"</a> (may be sung) continues until the Chaplain has gone to the
Altar, opened the Bible and backed to a point halfway between the Altar and East Dais. <a href="img/Plate 10.png" title="(Plate 10)">(Plate 10)</a></p>
     <p class="reading_font">CHAPLAIN: You will place your right hand over your heart and repeat the following pledge. The Chaplain places her right hand over her heart. The Officers assume the same position but do not
repeat the pledge. In the presence of these witnesses—I solemnly promise—that I will never divulge—the ritualistic ceremony of the Order—to anyone who is not entitled thereto;—that I will en-
courage the fidelity— of all members of Job's Daughters—by faithful observance of this pledge.
The Officers return hands to their sides as the Chaplain does. The Chaplain returns to her station. Altar music. One rap of the gavel (*).</p>
