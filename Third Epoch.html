     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: (rises) Pilgrims, it is my
        pleasure to impart to you the last lesson of our Order.
        As quoted from the Book of Job, "Thou shalt forget
        thy misery. Remember it as waters that are passed
        away and thy life shall rise brighter than the
        noonday."</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Guide and Marshal, you will conduct the Pilgrims
        east of the Altar for the lecture of the Fifth Messenger.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Honored Queen is seated.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Guide instructs the Pilgrims to follow her.
        March music: "Lead On, 0 King Eternal" or "Fairest
        Lord Jesus". The Guide turns left, marches to the North
        Marching Line, turns left, marches to the West Line, turns
        left on the West Line, then marches on a diagonal line
        between the stations of the Fourth and the Fifth
        Messengers through the semicircle to the Altar Line, turns
        left and stops so the Pilgrims are centered evenly spaced,
        east of the Altar, facing west. (Plate 29)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">GUIDE: Fifth Messenger, (rises) you will complete
        the story of Job.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">FIFTH MESSENGER: Walks east and takes position
        west of Altar between stations of the First and Third
        Messengers. (Plate 29)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The story of Job is a lesson of life. It has been
        handed down from generation to generation in the
        Sacred Writings. Whatever its antiquity, it is as true
        today as when it was written.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The members of this Order are just beginning the
        warfare of life - the trials of human existence. We are
        going forth on our pilgrimage filled with ambition and
        hope. All the magic of youth and the joy of life are
        ours, and our eyes are filled with wondering interest in
        the world's affairs.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">We know not what may be written in our book of
        destiny. There may come a time when, through
        adversity, we may be tried for our faith in the Great
        Creator of Heaven and earth. We may in the years to
        come be fettered by poverty and toil, yet in our hearts
        there should forever echo the remembrance of the
        trials of Job, his steadfastness to God and the reward
        for his righteousness.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Sacred Book informs us that Job was
        rewarded with twice as much of the world's goods as
        he had before, and that other sons and daughters were
        given to him. But above all, he enjoyed the blissful
        happiness of the commendation of God for his faith.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The closing chapter of the Book tells us, "In all the
        land were no women found so fair as the daughters of
        Job, and their father gave them inheritance among
        their brethren." Let it be our purpose so to live that
        the members of our Order will be known throughout
        the land as true Daughters of Job.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">land as true Daughters of Job.
        Chord for the Officers and Bethel Choir to rise. All
        Daughters sing <a href="Songs/70 Track 70.mp3" class="songs" target="_blank"> "I Know That My Redeemer Liveth"</a>,
        <a href="Songs/69 Track 69.mp3" class="songs" target="_blank"> "I

        Great Thou Art"</a>. Refer to Music Ritual. Chord to be
        seated.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">FIFTH MESSENGER: Guide and Marshal, you
        will conduct the Pilgrims to the Honored Queen.
        March music: "He Leadeth Me". The Fifth Messenger
        backs to her station and is seated. (Plate 29)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Guide instructs the Pilgrims to follow her. The
        Guide turns right, marches to the North Marching Line,
        turns right, marches to the East Line, turns right and
        marches south until the Pilgrims are centered, evenly
        spaced, directly in front of the Honored Queen, facing
        east. (Plate 30)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">GUIDE: Honored Queen, (rises) these Pilgrims
        have heard the story of the triumph of Job and are
        prepared for final instruction.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: Pilgrims, it is my pleasure to
        impart to you the closing lessons which we learn from
        the study of Job's life.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The three principal Officers of the Bethel are
        placed side by side in the East of the Bethel to
        represent the three daughters of Job of whom we read
        in the Holy Book.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The mystic number of this Epoch is five. It alludes
        to the messengers informing Job of his misfortune and
        the five Messengers who relate the story to the
        Pilgrims in Job's Daughters. The mystic numbers of
        our Order are seven, three and five, as explained in
        each Epoch.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The emblem of this Epoch is the Horn of Plenty,
        which symbolizes the triumph of Job over the
        temptations of the evil one, and the reward for his
        piety and faith. At the word "emblem" the Honored
        Queen extends her left hand toward the Hom of Plenty
        until the sentence is completed. It should ever remind
        us to advance with strength and power. It is also
        symbolic of the name of Job's third daughter whom he
        called Keren Happuch, which means "Plenty".</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Honored Queen picks up the Lily of the Valley
        with her right hand and places it in the palm of her left
        hand, holding the stems.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Lily of the Valley is the emblematic flower of
        our Order. From the retired place in which it grows
        we learn humility. It is white, and white in all ages has
        been deemed an emblem of purity. The Lily of the
        Valley teaches that beauty beams from purity
        throughout the vale of humility. Replaces the Lily of
        the Valley on the podium.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The sign of the Third Epoch is given (Honored
        Queen exemplifies the sign - Proficiency Lesson 6).
        Pilgrims, you will exemplify with me this sign. The
        Honored Queen exemplifies the sign a second time with
        the Pilgrims.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The response is (Honored Queen gives response -
        Proficiency Lesson 7). Pilgrims, you will repeat after
        me the response of the Third Epoch. The Honored
        Queen gives the response a second time; the Pilgrims
        repeat the response.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Senior Custodian, (rises and faces Honored Queen)
        you will approach the Altar, retire and exemplify the
        manner of leaving a Bethel while it is in session, after
        which you will ask the Outer Guard to admit you in
        the regular manner. The Guide and the Marshal instruct
        the Pilgrims to face west. The Senior Custodian leaves
        her station and retires in the regular manner. (Proficiency
        Lesson 8) She squares all comers and observes
        established floor lines. After the Senior Custodian has
        left the semicircle, she goes to the door and leaves
        without giving raps.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: (while the Senior Custodian is
        in the Anteroom) Senior Princess, (remains seated) you
        will explain the Salutation Sign and examination of a
        member who cannot be vouched for.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Honored Queen is seated. The Outer Guard
        gives raps at the door. The Inner Guard goes to the door,
        responds to the raps and opens the door.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">OUTER GUARD: Inner Guard, a member
        properly vouched for seeks admittance. The door is
        closed; the Inner Guard returns to her station and remains
        standing.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">INNER GUARD: Honored Queen, a member
        properly vouched for seeks admittance.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: You will admit her. The
        Inner Guard goes to the door and opens it.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">INNER GUARD: (facing west) Outer Guard, the
        member may be admitted. The Inner Guard faces north
        as the Senior Custodian enters. The Senior Princess rises
        as the Senior Custodian enters the Bethel Room. The
        door is closed; the Inner Guard returns to her station and
        is seated.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Senior Custodian times her actions to the words
        of the Senior Princess. The Senior Princess explains the
        Salutation Sign. (Proficiency Lesson 8) The Senior
        Custodian enters the semicircle between the stations of
        the Second and the Fifth Messengers and leaves between
        the stations of the Fourth and the Fifth Messengers. She
        returns to her station and is seated. The Guide and the
        Marshal then instruct the Pilgrims to face east.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Senior Princess does not address the Junior
        Princess until the Senior Custodian has returned to her
        1=m1 station and is seated.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">SENIOR PRINCESS: If a member's qualification
        to attend a meeting is ever questioned, she can prove
        her membership in Job's Daughters by taking an
        examination. Junior Princess, (rises) you will
        represent a member whom I will examine. The
        Princesses stand at an angle so that the signs may be
        easily seen by the Pilgrims.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">SENIOR PRINCESS: You will explain and
        exemplify the sign of the First Epoch.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">JUNIOR PRINCESS: (Proficiency Lesson 2)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">SENIOR PRINCESS: What is the response of the
        First Epoch?</p>
     <p class="reading_font">JUNIOR PRINCESS: (Proficiency Lesson 3)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">SENIOR PRINCESS: You will explain and
        exemplify the sign of the Second Epoch</p>

        Second Epoch?</p>

     <p class="reading_font">SENIOR PRINCESS: What is the response of the
        Third Epoch?</p>
     <p class="reading_font">JUNIOR PRINCESS: (Proficiency Lesson 7)</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Senior Princess and the Junior Princess nod to
        each other and are seated.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: (rises) Pilgrims, when you
        enter or retire from a Bethel in session, you will do as
        exemplified by our Senior Custodian. Each member is
        required to commit to memory the signs, responses, Obligation, Salutation Sign, Grip, and Mothers',
        Fathers' and Guardians' Prayer. The Guide will now
        give you the Grip of the Order.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Grip of Job's Daughters is given (Proficiency
        Lesson 9). The Guide gives the Grip to the first Pilgrim,
        timing her action to the words of the Honored Queen;
        then continues to each Pilgrim and returns to her position
        by passing behind the Pilgrims.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: We are taught that the fear
        of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, which includes
        both just thinking and right conduct. We hold high
        our aim and name of Job's Daughters which stands
        for:</p>
     <p class="reading_font">J - Joy with judgment,
        0 - Order being our first law,
        B - Beautiful and gracious in manner,
        S - Sincere in undertaking.
        D - Domineering over self,
        A - Abstain from evil,
        U - Upward and onward,
        G - God's name held in reverence,
        H - Hope never faileth,
        T - Truth always spoken,
        E - Eager for knowledge,
        R - Reaching toward the best,
        S - Steadfast and upright, we will face life
        squarely for future success.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">Guide and Marshal, you will conduct the Pilgrims
        west of the Altar. March music: "He Leadeth Me". The
        Guide instructs the Pilgrims to follow her. The Guide
        turns right, marches to the South Marching Line, marches
        to the Altar Line, turns and marches north, then west
        between the Altar and the station of the Chaplain to a
        point in line with the front of the Third Messenger's chair.
        The Guide turns and marches south between the stations
        of the First and the Third Messengers. All face east. The
        Guide and the Marshal assist the Pilgrims to kneel and
        assume the Attitude of Prayer. The Guide takes a position
        on the south side of the Pilgrims, the Marshal on the
        north. (Plate 31) The Guide and the Marshal face east
        when the Pilgrims are in position.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: Our Chaplain will lead us in
        prayer. Three raps of the gavel (***). Altar music:
        "Sweet Hour of Prayer" (may be sung).</p>
     <p class="reading_font">CHAPLAIN: Our Father, every blade of grass,
        every unfolding leaf, every flower, every planet and
        sun are visible expressions of Thy power, wisdom and
        love. We pray for Thy richest blessings to rest upon
        these Pilgrims. May it be their great joy to give our
        organization their loyal support. Help us, day by day,
        to be faithful and willing to leave results with Thee.
        Guide us, teach us, love us, and when the toils of earth
        are passed, receive us into Thine Eternal Home.
        Amen. All members respond by saying "Amen".</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Guide and the Marshal assist the Pilgrims to rise
        as the Chaplain rises. Altar music. The Chaplain returns
        to her station. One rap of the gavel(*).</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: (standing) Guide and
        Marshal, you will conduct the Pilgrims to the
        Recorder's desk to sign our Permanent Record Book.
        The Honored Queen is seated. The Recorder returns to the
        desk. All Daughters sing<a href="Songs/76 Track 76.mp3" class="songs" target="_blank"> "I Would Be True"</a> or
        <a href="Songs/77 Track 77.mp3>">"Heavenly Father, Bless Us"</a> or appropriate music may be
        played as the Pilgrims are conducted from the Altar to the
        Recorder's desk to sign the Permanent Record Book. The
        Guide instructs the Pilgrims to follow her. The Guide
        marches east past the Altar, turns left on the Altar Line,
        marches to the North Marching Line, turns right, marches
        to the East Line, and marches south, stopping at a point in
        line with the Junior Custodian's pedestal. The Guide, the
        Pilgrims, and the Marshal face south.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">The Guide and the Marshal alternately escort the
        Pilgrims to the Recorder's desk. (Plate 32) The Pilgrims
        sign their name only; other information will be entered by
        the Guardian Secretary.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">The Guide conducts the first Pilgrim, the Marshal
            conducts the next one and so on until all have signed. As
            each Pilgrim is conducted to the desk, the Guide or the
            Marshal sees that the other Pilgrims move so that the next
            Pilgrim to sign is in line with the Junior Custodian's
            pedestal. After the Pilgrims have signed the Permanent
            Record Book, they are escorted to seats reserved for them</p>
        <p class="reading_font">If the new members are to be seated on the south side
            of the room, the Guide seats the first new member, the
            Marshal seats the next one, and so on. The Officer
            finishing first shall advance west on the South Marching
            Line to a point just beyond the chair where the last new
            member is to be seated and remains until seating is completed. Then the Guide and the Marshal, side by side,
            return to their stations and are seated. (Plate 32) March
            music.</p>
        <p class="reading_font">If the new members are to be seated on the north side
            of the room, the Guide and the Marshal alternately escort
            each new member from the Recorder's desk until all are
            lined up on the South Marching Line. When the last one
            has signed, the Guide, followed by the new members and
            the Marshal, marches west on South Marching Line to the
            West Line, then to seats reserved for the new members.
            The Guide and the Marshal, side by side, return to their
            stations and are seated. March music.</p>
