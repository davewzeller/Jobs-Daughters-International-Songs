     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN WILL NOT REQUEST STATION AND DUTIES OF A VACANT OFFICE.
HONORED QUEEN: To see that the teachings of our Creator may be more deeply impressed upon our hearts and minds, let us listen carefully while each Officer explains her station and duties
with and with a lesson of love, purity and truth. Honored Queen is seated</p>

The Inner Guard turns right, goes to a point in line with the Anteroom door, turns right, goes to the Anteroom door and gives raps. The Outer Guard responds with raps and opens the door.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">INNER GUARD: (faces west) Outer Guard, the Honored Queen directs you to report to my station. The Inner Guard faces north inside the door as the Outer Guard walks past her to enter. The Inner Guard retires and closes the door. The Outer Guard goes east until on a line with the station of the Inner Guard, turns a square corner, goes to the station of the Inner Guard, and faces east.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: Outer Guard, where is your station and explain your duties.</p>
     <p class="reading_font">OUTER GUARD: (nods) Honored Queen, my station is outside the Anteroom door. My duty is to prevent interruptions during Bethel meetings and, with your permission, admit only those who are qualified. It teaches that we must guard against sin and protect ourselves from the temptations of the world to the end of our earthly journey.</p>  

  <p class="reading_font">HONORED QUEEN: Outer Guard, direct the Inner Guard to return to her station. The Outer Guard retraces her steps to the Anteroom and gives raps. The Inner Guard responds with raps and opens
the door.</p>
